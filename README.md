Welcome to the Supply Chain Volume Calculator. This tool is designed to calculate volume for units in a warehouse/supply chain enviroment. 
This can be used for verifying volume for items being stored in the warehouse. 
By running calculations and logical functions, the calculator will determine if an item's dimensions will fit inside of a location's dimensions. 
Insert the item's dimensions into the appropriate cells, and the calculator will perform the math and verify if the item will fit. 
Verify that the minimum and maximum values are divisible by the pack quantity.						
This is a demo version, as the original version contained confidential information revelant to the company it was used for. 
This version will only contain two calculators that highlights the tool's functionality.
